Making the RPi talk
================

We can make the Pi read out text and convert it to speech using Google's text to speech module for Python.

How to install gTTS
===============================

Open the terminal and type in:

    sudo pip3 install gTTS

You will also need to install mpg321 to play the sound. Again, using terminal type in:

    sudo apt-get install mpg321
