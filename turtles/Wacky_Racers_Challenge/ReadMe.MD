# Turtles Wack Racers

## RPI CHALLENGE

### How this works
The simple game coded here is a 2 player game where turtles race to the finish line.
The challenge for students is to replace the turtle with 2 rows of LED lights that light up as each Turtle reaches
a specific point on the stage.

Finally the last LED (which could be a different colour than the previous lights of the same row) will flash for the winning racer.

## EXTENSION
The keyboard button can be replaced with a physical button (like a tactile button)
