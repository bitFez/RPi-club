# sending an email

We can use a python library called smtplib to send an email via gmail. You can read more about the library here:

    http://docs.python.org/2/library/smtplib.html

To use the demo, you'll need to change the gmail username and password at the top, and then change the recipient's email address at the bottom of the file. You must use a gmail account to use this demo!

If you get an error about not being able to connect, it's probably to do with network restrictions like a firewall.
