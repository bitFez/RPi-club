# flashing an LED

Flashing an led is a good first example. The code is commented well, so be sure to read that.

# Fading an LED

We can use PWM for fading an LED. The documentation for using PWM is here: 
https://code.google.com/p/raspberry-gpio-python/wiki/PWM

# Connections

add an LED and a resistor in series to pin 8 of the header. There is an example circuit on the workshop resources.
