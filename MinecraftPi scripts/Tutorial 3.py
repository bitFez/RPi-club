# Name:        Minecraft Tutorial 3
# Purpose:     A game in which 3 gold blocks are added to the world randomly
#              The player must find the 3 blocks
# Author:      edited by AMulla, Forked on github from Mark East
# Created:     26/08/2013
# Extension:   Add a timer to the game so that the player must find the gold
#              blocks within a time limit.
